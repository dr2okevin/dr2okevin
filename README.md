# dr2okevin
Welcome to my github profile. I'm a Professional PHP/TYPO3 Developer from Germany.  
Here you can see a small selection of my private projects.
For the last 10 years I have mainly worked with TYPO3, but unfortunately I can't show any of that here.

My biggest private project is Freifunk Pinneberg, an open WiFi mesh network. The repositories for this are [grouped in an organization profile](https://github.com/freifunk-pinneberg).

Besides working with PHP I also like to do random stuff with Linux, I like little electronics projects like my [Geiger Counter](https://github.com/dr2okevin/esp32-geigercounter), and I'm very instrested in AI.
I'm a logic and absolutly not a design person, so stuff I make is usally functional, but not pretty.
